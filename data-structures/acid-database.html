Atomicity => normally database transactions consist of multiple statements. when one of those multiple 
statments fail what needs to be ensured is that database has not been changed. This has to be maintained
in bad and unappropriate situations like power failure, code error and crashes.<p></p>

Consistency => This states that the data that gets inserted into database should be a valid and a 
consistent one.<p></p>


Isolation => while we can perform multiple transactions in multiple tables at the same time. This states
that it should work as if they were being carried out as a single command.

Durability => If somehow database fails or crashes or some unexpected events take place data should be 
intact and safe. for future usages.
